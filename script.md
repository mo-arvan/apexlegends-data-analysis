Ultimately in a fight, a player who deals the most damage wins. 
Time-to-kill (TTK) is the amount of time it takes to kill an enemy, is a common term in FPS games and is used to describe the amount of time it takes to kill an enemy.
The problem is in reality, the actual TTK differs from the theoretical TTK, since no one can hit all their shots.
This leaves players to decide which weapon is the best based on "the feel" of the weapon.
This works fine for the most part, except it is not based on concrete data.
My current findings match the Pro Players' opinions, R99 is the best weapon in the game.
But, let's try to figure out why.
