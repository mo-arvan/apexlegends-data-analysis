> You can now access the "Fights" tab. All fights that happened in the game will be listed (a fight is defined by damage
> events, and a fight is considered as "ended" when there has been no damage events for 15s for any of the players
> involved in the fight). You can click each players in the left list to see their damage per weapon/ability, total
> healing for all players involved in the fight, and statistics for all players involved in the fight. All players will
> have a matching color similar to all other tabs.


In the future with full access to the raw damage data, we might be able to customize the definition of a fight and how
accuracy is accounted for.
