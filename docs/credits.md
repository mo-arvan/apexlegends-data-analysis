Hi, I'm Mo, I'm a Computer Scientist working in the field of Machine Learning.
I'm also a gamer, I play Apex
Legends. This was a fun project I started during the holidays due to boredom. Everything is free, open source, and
available on [Github](https://github.com/mo-arvan/apexlegends-data-analysis). I hope this analysis helps the scene to 
grow.
