#### Why

Using metrics such as TTK (Time-to-Kill), DPS (Damage Per Second), or even the subjective "feel" of a weapon can provide initial insights into its effectiveness. However, these metrics have their limitations. For instance, no player lands every shot, meaning the actual TTK often differs from the theoretical TTK. Moreover, the "feel" of a weapon varies from player to player and can introduce bias, as preferences may lead players to overlook potentially suitable weapons they haven't tried. To address these issues, I propose the concept of "effective TTK" (eTTK), which adjusts the TTK based on your accuracy. This metric offers a more accurate estimate of a weapon's Time-to-Kill, helping you determine the best weapon for your gameplay. Thanks to [Hugo](https://www.patreon.com/hugodev) we have access to

Accuracy in gaming is influenced by various factors, some of which players can directly control. These include gameplay mechanics like recoil control, target tracking, and strategic positioning. On the other hand, factors such as the scenario's difficulty—dictated by the distance to the target, their movement, or available cover—are outside direct player control. Through consistent training, players and analysts can leverage this data to monitor progress and enhance performance. The ultimate objective of this analysis is to help players win more consistently. For players who have reached a performance plateau, I recommend conducting video on-demand (VOD) reviews. This can help assess the difficulty of specific scenarios and determine whether failures were due to poor mechanics or other factors.
