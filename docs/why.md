#### Why

Using TTK, DPS, or even the "feel" of a weapon, you can perform a quick analysis and determine which weapon is
the best. However, these metrics are not perfect. No one can hit all of their shots, so, the actual TTK is different
from the theoretical TTK. Furthermore, the "feel" of a weapon is subjective and varies from player to player. I'm not
saying the "feel" is not important, but sometimes people are biased towards a weapon and ignore other weapons might not
even get a chance to try them. At the end of the day, I believe it is possible to use data to determine the best weapon
for you. I introduce the concept of "effective TTK" (eTTK) which gives you the TTK given your accuracy. This way, we
will be able
to get better estimate for Time-to-kill (TTK). Thanks to [Hugo](https://www.patreon.com/hugodev) we have access to
accuracy data of ALGS games since Year 3 Split 1.

Accuracy is impacted by several factors, some of which are under players' direct control. I am talking about the 
mechanics or how well can you play the game. Recoil control, tracking, or even
positioning fall under this category. Difficulty of the scenario on the other hand is not under players' direct control.
I am talking about the distance, the movement of the target, or the cover. Through training, players and analysts can 
utilize this data to track their progress and improve their performance. Ultimately, the goal of this analysis is to
help you win games more consistently. If a player has peaked and has reached a plateau, I recommend VOD reviews to
estimate the difficulty of the scenario and determine whether poor mechanics was the cause of the death or not.
